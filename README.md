# Lizards-problem

Problem statement: You are to find a place to put each baby lizard in a nursery. The baby lizards have very long tongues. They can shoot out their tongue up, down, left, right and diagonally to eat other baby lizards. Their tongues are very long and can reach to the edge of the nursery from any location.

Figure (A) the baby lizard can attack any other lizard in a red square. (B) In this example setup, both lizards can eat each other. You need to avoid such cases.

<br />
Moreover, nursery may have some trees planted in it. The lizards cannot shoot their tongues through the trees nor can you move a lizard into the same place as a tree. A tree will block any lizard from eating another lizard if it is in the path.

Both nurseries have valid arrangements of baby lizards such that they cannot eat one
another.
